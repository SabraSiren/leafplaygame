          `GeoHell is a minimalist 2D endless platformer where precision matters more than speed. You control a black cube running to the right through procedurally generated levels filled with lava, spikes, and deadly enemies. One mistake can end your run — and push you to try again.`,
          `Gameplay`,
          `Run, jump, and crouch using a virtual joystick to survive shifting platforms, narrow gaps, and sudden hazards. The further you go, the tougher it gets. Your score is simple: distance in meters.`,
          `Beat your best run. Then beat it again.`,
          `Hazards`,
          `Expect lava pools, spike traps, low ceilings, and flying enemies. Learn patterns, time your jumps, and stay in control. GeoHell rewards focus, precision, and smart movement.`,
          `Power-ups`,
          `Use rare power-ups wisely:
• Clear all enemies on screen
• Get a short speed boost
• Respawn at the last checkpoint`,
          `Earn daily bonuses by reaching distance goals.`,
          `Progress & Competition`,
          `Track your all-time best and daily distance. Send your record to the online leaderboard and see how far others made it. A short tutorial gets you started in seconds.`,
          `Why you'll like GeoHell`,
          `• Fast, skill-based runs
• Simple controls, deep challenge
• Procedurally generated levels
• Dark, stylish geometric visuals
• One goal: go farther than ever before`,
          `One cube. One run. One number that matters.`,
